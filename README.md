### Issues / Reporting a Bug

  * Update to the most recent version of the master branch.
  * Search for similar issues. Someone may have encountered the same bug already.
  * Provide information about the problem, preferrably with a code example that allows us to recreate the problem. If you are unable to provide code, please be sure to provide specific information and steps to reproduce the error. If the error cannot be reproduced, the ticket will be closed.
  * The issue and code example will be verified and tested. We will do our best to work with you until the issue can be verified and reproduced. The more information you provide, the easier and faster we can validate the error and work towards fixing the issue.
  * Stay in touch and up to date! If the ticket becomes stale, the ticket may be closed.
  * If possible, why not take a chance and try to fix the bug and submit a PR? What better way to learn?!

### Pull Requests

We love help from the community. Here is an overview on how you can help:

  1. Fork the repo.
  2. Create your own branch off of `master`. Name your branch `your-github-username/specific-feature-or-bug-description`.
  3. Do work. Commit to your local branch.
  4. When your are ready to submit a PR, rebase `master` onto your local branch. If there are any conflicts, they will need to be fixed first.
  5. Once there are no conflicts, push your local branch to your remote branch.
  6. Create a Pull Request from your remote branch to the `master` branch.
